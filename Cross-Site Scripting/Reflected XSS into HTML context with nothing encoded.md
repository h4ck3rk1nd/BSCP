#### The page appears to be a blog site:

#### At the very first glance, there is an input field at the top of the blog site, that says, _Search the blog..._
#### The next step would be to check if the site is vulnerable to XSS.
#### Try to input a random text in the search tab as:

#### After entering a random text, click on the Search button to see the results of the search as:

#### Thereâ€™s no blog post with the name h4ck3rk1nd but the site does use the user input to render the search result, meaning the site is vulnerable to **Reflected-XSS**.
#### Try to input an inline script in the search tab as the payload to trigger the Reflected-XSS, when the search result gets rendered as:

#### Once the payload is entered, click on the Search button and the Reflected-XSS should trigger as:

#### Thus, the challenge is solved with kindness
